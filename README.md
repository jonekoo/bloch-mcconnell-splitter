# bloch-mcconnell-splitter
A matlab class that implements a matrix representation and solver for the Bloch-McConnell equations of a three-pool system. The class uses the operator-splitting approach.
The code here is inspired by the original implementation by Graf et al. which is available at https://github.com/GrafChristina/BlochSim
